WhackAMole
==========

This is a very basic "Whack a Mole" game that I made several years ago. I stumbled on this code and figured I might as well throw it up to GitHub.

Note: The background image seems to have gone MIA, so it is substituted with something not ideal. The old background had a scoreboard and grassy hills, and it truly was a work of art. The mole artwork is original though and will give you a rough idea of how magnificent the background was.
